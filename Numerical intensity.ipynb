       "\"Thank you, Steve. Earlier today, we announced results for our second quarter of fiscal 2005. International Rectifier reported adjusted earnings of $44.8 million, or $0.62 per share in the December quarter, excluding a $6.8 million pretax charge for ongoing severance and restructuring activities. On a GAAP basis, net income was $39.5 million, or $0.55 per share in the December quarter, versus 37.6 million, or $0.53 per share in the September quarter, and $16.9 million, or $0.25 per share in the prior-year quarter. Revenues were 298.6 million in the December quarter, down 4 percent from $312.2 million in the September quarter and up 18 percent from the 252.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Bookings for proprietary products rose 2 percent from the prior quarter and 13 percent over the prior-year quarter. Total company bookings were down 2 percent from the September quarter. OEM orders were flat with the prior quarter and up 5 percent from the prior year. Distribution orders were down 2 percent from the September quarter and down 19 percent year-on-year. Our December gross margins increased another 60 basis points from the prior quarter, hitting an all-time record of 43.3 percent. We generated $76 million in cash from operations and ended the quarter at $839 million in total cash and cash investments. IR's inventories were essentially flat, quarter-to-quarter, at $161.5 million. Lead times per components were four to eight weeks, down a couple weeks from the September quarter, and pricing was firm, down less than 1 percent as expected. Distributor inventories of our products remain lean. IR shipments into the channel were down 8 percent and distributor sales of our products were down 2 percent. OEM inventories of IR products were also lean. We built our proprietary products to forecast with minimum inventory overhang risks. In our component business, which represents 31 percent of our revenues this quarter, inventories declined, keeping turns constant. SG&A was $40.9 million, or 13.7 percent of revenues in the December quarter, compared to 15.1 percent a year ago and 14.9 percent in the September quarter. SG&A declined as we cut these expenses and invested $2 million more in R&D to accelerate the development plans for our proprietary products. We also had a reduction in SG&A due to variable costs on lower revenues. We are targeting SG&A to be about flat in dollars for the rest of 2005. The Company invested $27.7 million in research and development in the December quarter, compared to $25.4 million in the September quarter. In fiscal 2005, we expect R&D to be about $110 million. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million, compared to $28.5 million in the September quarter and $13.3 million a year ago. For fiscal 2005, we plan to maintain capital expenditures of less than 10 percent of revenues. Depreciation and amortization expense was $18.7 million, compared to 18.4 million in the September quarter and 15.4 million in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2005, we expect depreciation to be about $75 million. Royalties were 10.5 million, and we expect 10 million in royalties, plus or minus a million dollars, in the March quarter. As we discussed last quarter, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 22.8 percent due to the catch-up benefit from the R&D tax credit that was approved by Congress in October. For the remainder of 2005, we expect a 25.5 percent tax rate, plus or minus half a percent. We anticipate approximately $8 million in severance and restructuring charges in the second half of the fiscal year for the restructuring announced in December 2002. Let me give you an update on the $100 million carve out. As we previously total you, we carved out $14 million of quarterly revenues in June 2004, and the carve out of an additional $11 million of quarterly revenues is expected to come from the divestiture of our high-power unit. We are an active discussions with a buyer who just completed their due diligence. Now, Alex will comment on recent developments and International Rectifier's business conditions and outlook. \""
